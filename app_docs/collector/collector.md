### **Field Worker Login: Professional Feature Breakdown**  

To ensure a **secure, intuitive, and field-friendly** login experience for workers, here are the **must-have features** and UX considerations:  

---

#### **üîê 1. Secure Authentication**  
- **Email + Password Login**  
  - Workers log in with credentials pre-configured by the admin.  
  - Passwords are **hashed** (never stored in plain text).  
- **JWT Tokens** for session management (expires after 24 hours for security).  
- **Rate Limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks (e.g., 5 attempts max).  

#### **üì≤ 2. Field-Optimized UX**  
- **Low-Tech Input**  
  - Large, clear input fields (easy to use on small/touchscreen devices).  
  - Option to toggle password visibility (avoid typos).  
- **Offline Login Cache**  
  - If offline, workers can log in with **recently used credentials** (cached securely).  
  - Syncs auth status when back online.  
- **Quick Relogin**  
  - "Remember me" option (stores encrypted credentials for 7 days).  

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è 3. Error Handling & Recovery**  
- **Clear Error Messages**  
  - "Incorrect password" (generic to avoid security hints).  
  - "Account disabled" (redirects to admin contact).  
- **Password Reset Flow**  
  - Admins handle resets (no self-service to prevent misuse).  
  - Workers request reset via **SMS/WhatsApp to admin** (for zero tech barriers).  

#### **üåç 4. Low-Connectivity Support**  
- **Progressive UI Feedback**  
  - Loading spinner + "Working offline" banner if connection drops.  
  - Auto-retry when network restores.  
- **No Heavy Dependencies**  
  - Avoid OAuth (Google/Facebook) ‚Äî unreliable in rural areas.  

#### **üìä 5. Security Extras (Optional but Recommended)**  
- **Location Verification**  
  - Logs GPS coordinates during login (detect suspicious locations).  
- **Device Whitelisting**  
  - Admins approve devices to prevent unauthorized access.

### **üéØ Why This Works for Field Workers**  
1. **Zero Frustration**  
   - Large buttons, cached logins, and no complex steps.  
2. **Works Anywhere**  
   - Offline fallbacks + SMS-based admin support.  
3. **Fraud Prevention**  
   - JWT expiration + rate limiting + optional device checks.  

### **Next Steps**  
- Pair this with a **dead-simple contribution form** (next priority).  
- Test on **low-end Android devices** in real-world conditions.  

This approach balances **security**, **usability**, and **field realities**.
